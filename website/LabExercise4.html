<h1><b>The Real Benefits of Video Games</h1></b>

<h2>Online games can foster genuine psychological benefits and feelings of community, experts say.</h2>

    Online games have been historically portrayed as what people in research call pseudo-communities,” said Dr.<br> Rachel Kowert, the research director of the nonprofit Take This, who studies the psychological effects of video <a href = "https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/amp-a0034857.pdf" target="_blank">games.</a> <br>In some corners of culture, the long-held stereotype of gamers as socially maladjusted loners still persists. <br>And when the social potential of gaming is acknowledged, it’s still brushed off as an inferior substitution to “real” human connection.
</p>
<p>
    The value of the <a href = "https://sometimes-homemade.com/social-connection-meaning" target="_blank">social</a> connections are assumed to be somehow less than the value of the social connections that we have in face-to-face interactions,” Kowert added.<br> “But if you look at the research, that’s actually not true. Gamers have many different reasons for playing. <br>According to a 2023 Entertainment Software Association (ESA) report, some of the top reasons people play video games are to have fun, pass time and de-stress. <br>Whatever motivations gamers have, many of them are able to tap into gaming’s benefits.   
</p>
<p> 
    It seemed to be quite a positive thing for the games we surveyed, which were all online <a href = "https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/multiplayer-gaming" target="_blank"> multiplayer</a> gamers.<br> It was positive both individually and in terms of a broader social connection. “Gamers often report that that common interest in itself can actually build friendships and relationships <br> so that common focus can be really important socially,” Kaye said.
    There’s a growing body of other relevant research as well.<br> Kowert edited a collection called Video Games and Well-Being: Press Start, in which authors incorporate a variety of academic research to explore the psychological benefits, including connectedness, of gaming.

    When talking about how games can be socially valuable, there is a lot of research that specifically found reductions in loneliness and <a href = "https://www.healthcentral.com/condition/depression/loneliness-and-depression" target="_blank">depression,</a> and that it’s particularly valuable for people who are geographically isolated, Kowert said.<br> Online, game-rooted friendships “are as real as any offline friendships,” Kowert said, “and they shouldn’t be discredited just because they’re mediated through technology.” <br> If you’ve ever wondered if games like Animal Crossing or Mario Kart can help contribute to cognitive development, the answer is yes. 
    Online, game-rooted <a href = "https://playcentgames.com/the-art-of-making-viable-friendships-through-online-gaming/" target="_blank">friendships</a> “are as real as any offline friendships,” Kowert said, “and they shouldn’t be discredited just because they’re mediated through technology.<br> Gaming is good for your brain’s gray matter, the outer layer of brain tissue that contributes to motor skills, memory and emotional response. <br>One study from 2015 compared gamers who had reached expert levels in action-based video games with novice players. The researchers found that expert players had increased volumes of gray matter and greater functional connectivity.  
</p>
<p>
    We propose that video games, by their very nature, have design elements aligned with attributes of well-being, and that playing video games can provide opportunities for <a href = "https://www.carleton.edu/health-promotion/mental-health/flourishing/#:~:text=Flourishing%20is%20feeling%20good%20about,are%20unique%20for%20each%20individual." target="_blank">flourishing</a> mental health.<br> People who regularly play video games may experience decreased levels of stress too. A 2009 study found that casual video gaming created changes in brain activity consistent with improved mood and less avoidant behavior.<br>
    The aforementioned 2023 ESA study confirms these findings, revealing that 71 percent of people feel less stressed when playing video games, 61 percent feel less anxious and 58 percent feel less isolated or lonely.<br>
    But in extremely online times, we might as well try all the help we can get. “It’s about finding alternative ways of keeping [face-to-face] connections and conversations going,” Kaye said, “and using more creative <a href = "https://www.voitec.com.au/creative-virtual/" target="_blank">virtual</a> ways to do so.<br> Of course, simply firing up Fortnite won’t instantaneously transform those who might feel lonely into online social butterfli  es. “Some players can be in social environments and still not interact much with others,” said Kaye, pointing to a 2006 research paper that explored the “alone together” phenomenon in MMOs.
